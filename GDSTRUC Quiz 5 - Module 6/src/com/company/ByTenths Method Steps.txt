Name: By Tenth Method

Notes:
*Array should be sorted from low to high
*only useful for arrays with 50 and up length
*my example code is janky and full of holes but I hope it shows the idea

Steps:
1. divide the length of the array by 10 
(example:  length = 50, so the tenth of 50 is 5)

2. check every tenth of the array if its bigger than the input 
(example: if the tenth is 5, check the index 0,5,10,15... etc if its bigger than input)

3. if found, check every previous indexes until the number on that index is equal to input. stop until you reaches the previous tenth index
(example: if the number on index 25 is bigger than the input, check index 24,23,22,21. if it reaches index 20, the input you are looking for is not here)
